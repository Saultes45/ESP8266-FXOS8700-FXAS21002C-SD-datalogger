# ESP8266-FXOS8700-FXAS21002C-SD-datalogger



This code is a single sript file and a signgle header. This simple code has been made for a short term datalogger (running for max ~6h). It is made for arduino IDE or platformIO. It is based on the low power ESP8266, an Openlog to capture the UART (to which the sensor data are sent) and an IMU sensor (from Adafruit)
